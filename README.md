# CONTRACT.XYZ

Welcome to Contract.xyz, a hackathon project aimed at solving the issues of trust in the tech community, specifically for developers and individuals with soft skills. This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and how to get started with the smart contracts that power Contract.xyz.

## Overview

Contract.xyz addresses the trust deficit often encountered by individuals showcasing their skills or entering agreements in the digital space. Whether you're a developer, someone with soft skills, or an everyday person, Contract.xyz provides a secure way to verify identities and sign agreements.

Recruiters and collaborators often need assurance that the individuals they are engaging with are legitimate. To solve this, Contract.xyz leverages the ZKYC feature from zkPass. Our platform allows individuals to sign agreements using their wallet addresses. Contract.xyz then uses ZKYC to fetch and verify their KYC details from trusted platforms like Binance, providing an additional layer of trust.

## Features

Trust Verification: Ensures that individuals entering agreements are verified and trustworthy.
ZKYC Integration: Uses zkPassâ€™s ZKYC to fetch and verify KYC details from platforms like Binance.
Decentralized Agreements: Users can sign agreements with their wallet addresses, ensuring security and transparency.
Universal Application: Whether you are a developer, a freelancer, a service provider, or a common individual, Contract.xyz provides a platform to secure your agreements and verify identities.
